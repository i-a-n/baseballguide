Ever find yourself wondering who won the 2003 MLB World Series? How about who had the highest batting average in the National League in 1997?

This is a short, colorful guide to MLB history, broken down by era and season. It's meant to be a quick reference with concise copy, not a comprehensive baseball reference.
